    Order and sorted Map implementation:-------------------------------------
    -> The Map interface has the LinkedHashMap and TreeMap classes.
    -> The LinkedHashMap is a key value entry collection whose keys are ordered by insertion order.
    -> The TreeMap is sorted by its keys, so a key needs to implement comparable,
       or be initialized with a specific comparator.
